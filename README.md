<h2>Short development history</h2>
<h3>Idea</h3>
First idea was that game will be about a half-god who takes care of a monstrous furnace in the Earth's core.
Some day something went wrong and furnace got too much carbon and that begun main core meltdown.
And now action of game could start.

After designing first levels turned out that levels with narrow vertical shafts are monotonous. Jumping from left to right and vice versa
wasn't interesting.
