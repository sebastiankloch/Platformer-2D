<h2>Short development history</h2>
<h3>Idea</h3>
First idea was that game will be about a half-god who takes care of a monstrous furnace in the Earth's core.
Some day something went wrong and furnace got too much carbon and that begun main core meltdown.
And now action of game could start.

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
Main target of player supposed to be running away from magma. So our hero needed some climbing skills, because he had to move up to escape. At that day me planed to make this game as endless runner.

After designing first levels turned out that levels with narrow vertical shafts are monotonous. Jumping from left to right and vice versa wasn't interesting. So we decided that there must be done some changes. We thought about adding special key which could open shorter paths to gain more time, but that was still without potential. So we changed story.
<p>

Now game supposed to be about young man who works in geothermal power station near Earth's core. Again something went wrong and hero must run. But this time he must slow down magma to allow evacuate people living underground, but that was still not enough.  
</p>
<p>
So there showed up idea about adding victims that during evacuation couldn't escape. Main task of player was to slow down magma, when 
victims will running away. But there wasn't many ways to add upgrades or any other solution to increase monetization of our game. So why don't add drones which will take unconscious victims. But at that day we wanted to make manual calling of drones so player would have to call drones, go slow down magma, back and call another drones and again slow down magma. This could be too repeatable and because of that we changed again assumptions.
</p>
<p>
Current story is about firefighter, who works in underground cites after The Great War, when surface of earth is poisoned by toxic gases. Action takes place in main vent of Yellowstone volcano after colling down of earth core as a result of the massive use of geothermal energy during war.
</p>
<p>
We wanted ability to use way around victims, when player doesn't want to save victims, or simple hasn't enough upgraded drones and this is too difficult for player. Player has ability too call three types of drones: ambulance, supply, firefighter.<br>
 - ambulance drone can take victims from danger area.<br>
 - supply drone can give hero pack of ammo, bandages and other stuff.<br>
 - firefighter drone can extinguish fire in selected area.<br>
But very important was to have at least simple conflangration system.
</p>
<p>
After losing motivation to first idea we wanted to make little sanbox game.
We started prototyping.

</p>

<p>
During tests at bigger scale turned out that it is imposible to do conflangration with scale that we wanted.<br>
We made flames in sandbox only as information for player that in this bulding is conflangration.<br>
We moved real fire to separate scene, but there where still recurrence of building construction.
</p>

<p>
To save more time we resigned from sandbox and focused more on missions. We also resigned from endless runner form.<br>

<i>We rewrited all conflangration scripts using our own collision system</i>
