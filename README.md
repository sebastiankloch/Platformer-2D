<h2>Short development history</h2><br>
<h3>Idea</h3><br>
First idea was that game will be about a half-god who takes care of a monstrous furnace in the Earth's core.  
Some day something went wrong and furnace got too much carbon and that begun main core meltdown.  
And now action of game could start.



First playable version of game.
